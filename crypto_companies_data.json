    "overview": "Dear Investor,\n\nI\u2019m writing this article to dismiss a popular myth: Many investors believe it\u2019s already too late to make a lot of money with Bitcoin.\n\nNothing could be further from the truth.\n\nHere's why:\n\nThe incredible story of how I missed the boat on Bitcoin, still got rich, and how you can do the same.\n\nThe year is 2009. I am sitting in my office in Asunci\u00f3n, Paraguay where I made a life-changing discovery. An intriguing document has just crossed my desk. It was talking about a new kind of digital money called \u201cBitcoin\u201d. As I read it, I immediately realized what a potential breakthrough this new technology could be. But of course, I was skeptical. Unsure if it would work in practice. I decided to buy a few Bitcoins just in case it was for real and would go on to become successful.\n\nAfter all, one Bitcoin was worth just a few cents. So I went online to see where I could buy some. But there was a problem. There was no marketplace to buy or sell Bitcoin. Bitcoin was too new. Such exchanges simply didn\u2019t exist yet. I knew there was a process for \u201cmining\u201d Bitcoin. But I didn\u2019t want to spend days setting up an extra computer. And then install the software, figure out how it worked and keep watching over my mining computer. It was too much of a hassle just to get my hands on some Bitcoin that was worth almost nothing at the time. So I decided to keep an eye on Bitcoin and monitor its progress.\n\nFast forward to February 2011. I had gotten busy with other projects and suddenly remembered to check on Bitcoin. I was shocked to see that the price was over $1. I had missed the boat. Bitcoin had skyrocketed up well over 1,000%. I instantly regretted that I didn\u2019t take it more seriously right away and didn\u2019t go through the effort to acquire some coins when I first heard about the technology.\n\n",

    "overview": "Bitcoin is an innovative payment network and a new kind of money. \n\nAs a new user, you can get started with Bitcoin without understanding the technical details. Once you've installed a Bitcoin wallet on your computer or mobile phone, it will generate your first Bitcoin address and you can create more whenever you need one. You can disclose your addresses to your friends so that they can pay you or vice versa. In fact, this is pretty similar to how email works, except that Bitcoin addresses should be used only once. \n\nThe blockchain is a shared public ledger on which the entire Bitcoin network relies. All confirmed transactions are included in the block chain. It allows Bitcoin wallets to calculate their spendable balance so that new transactions can be verified thereby ensuring they're actually owned by the spender. The integrity and the chronological order of the block chain are enforced with cryptography.\n\nA transaction is a transfer of value between Bitcoin wallets that gets included in the block chain. Bitcoin wallets keep a secret piece of data called a private key or seed, which is used to sign transactions, providing a mathematical proof that they have come from the owner of the wallet. The signature also prevents the transaction from being altered by anybody once it has been issued. All transactions are broadcast to the network and usually begin to be confirmed within 10-20 minutes, through a process called mining.\n\nMining is a distributed consensus system that is used to confirm pending transactions by including them in the block chain. It enforces a chronological order in the block chain, protects the neutrality of the network, and allows different computers to agree on the state of the system. To be confirmed, transactions must be packed in a block that fits very strict cryptographic rules that will be verified by the network. These rules prevent previous blocks from being modified because doing so would invalidate all the subsequent blocks.",

While this is a great and concept, Bounce focusses on the opposite scenario instead. \nBounce provides a competitive environment, for a limited supply of tokens or other assets like NFT's. The assets can be auctioned off in various ways, such as:\n\nToken Sales: Various types of auctions  where a limited amount of tokens are auctioned off with different auction principles and time limits, such as fixed price (fixed swap auction), decreasing price (Dutch auction) or  hidden price (sealed-bid auction)\n\nNFT Auctions: NFT's are auctioned off with similar auction principles as token sales. However, there is usually a lower number of NFT's (or only a unique piece) for sale.\n\nMulti Wallet Support: The Bounce platform works with the most commonly used cryptocurrency wallets, such as MetaMask, Binance Chain wallet, WalletConnect, Coinbase Wallet, Ledger and Trezor. More wallets will be supported in the future.",

There are solutions offered to automatically switch the coins that are mined in order to boost profit, or to point the miners to a service that will automatically pay a client in Bitcoins. These processes can be run in tandem offering the easiest and most profitable solution in the mining industry, and come standard on every machine.\n\nThe machines are designed in enclosed cases that stack securely on another unit of like or greater size. The custom case allows for maximal protection in a home environment while providing excellent cooling.  Filters are strategically placed on the intake side of the machine to prevent dust build up and help provide optimal conditions for the machine. One-hundred and forty millimeter fans are used on a low-speed setting to keep the air flowing without creating disturbances and minimizing fan noise. Only Platinum rated power supplies containing premium grade components designed to run in 24/7/365 applications are used to achieve maximum efficiency.\n\nCurrently, these machines are GPU powered and simply require a client to modify a file to choose which coin a client wishes to mine.

We believe in a positive future for Bitcoin but doubt that Bitcoin is the best asset for long-term investments given the inherent focus on \u201cpayments\u201d (in which it competes with stable coins) rather than long-term value storage.\n\nWe seek to invest in sustainable digital assets, which are pure investment assets designed to appreciate over time and without Bitcoin-inherent issues (e.g., mining reward algorithm leading to negative pricing pressure). These are sentiment-driven assets. We are convinced that the right digital assets will increase attractiveness in an environment characterized by continuous quantitative easing and rising regulation and their unique advantages compared to other forms of storing value (e.g., easy to store, easy to transfer, deflationary, secure from corrupt governments or censorship). Especially in developing countries and for the unbanked, these features allow the creation of wealth for the first time in human history.\n\nIn addition, we will start to develop a position in startups in the blockchain space, working together with existing incubators and funds, leveraging our exclusive access to Switzerland\u2019s Crypto Valley.\n\nGiven the diverse backgrounds of the founding partners, the company is well-positioned to master the challenges of this rapidly evolving ecosystem and take advantage of investment opportunities that emerge through the blockchain as new general-purpose technology.

We were fascinated by the process of permanently generating coins from a graphics card.\n\nSubsequently Claudiu Schuster founded Spreadblock ehf. in March 2017.\n\nSince then we have been dealing with the topic of cryptocurrencies and mining.\n\nMy business partner and \"Solidity\"\u200b programmer Claudiu Schuster and I, Patrick Br\u00fcckling, founded Smart Mining ehf. in August 2018.\n\nSmart Mining ehf. is a completely transparent mining pool operator located in Iceland. \nWe developed the \u201cSMT-Token\u201d on the Ethereum Blockchain to give the maximum trust and transparency. \n\nWe would like to finance ourselves through an \"Initial Coin Offering\"\u200b / \u201cCrowd-sale\u201d on the Ethereum blockchain. Our smart contracts can be reviewed and confirmed on \"etherscan.io\"\u200b.  and \u201cgithub.io\u201d.\n\nWe developed the SMT-Token, not to be tradeable or something else. It\u2019s locked over the contract duration and serves as a transparent proof of our customers.\n\nPayouts secured by smart-contracts. \n\nAs we know, the Ethereum price can fluctuate widely. The difficulty also reacts to it. Of course, the mining rewards fluctuate with this.\nWe designed a calculator at our homepage to show that.\n\nJust scroll through the Ethereum difficulty history compared to the price history. You can get an impression of how your \u201cprofit or resulting hashrate\u201d will look like during our 4 years contract period. It\u2019s like a \u201cDynamic Hashrate\u201d. \n\nThis model is unique until now in the cloud-mining sector, as normally cloud-mining providers do not share the whole company revenue with their clients, and of course do not allow clients to take a detailed view into their internal accounting.\n\n\nTo get a brief overview you can also take a look at our OnePager: https://cdn.smart-mining.io/SMT-OnePager.pdf\n\n",

Node will auto mine blocks as per the time setup by the admin (min 1 sec) and also admin can setup their own reward programs based on the community demands.  Our blockchain will eliminate traditional mining which consumes a lot of energy and eradicates the usage of sophisticated / high end devices for mining. Our system will enable the Validators to validate the nodes even by using the mobile phone / Laptops, computers etc. of specific configuration & features. PoS support validators and validator is the word that was derived from PoA (Proof of Authority) where we can decide reward programs. It's a kind of a fixed algorithm in which we will have validator nodes in POA. In POA we can have our validator nodes or can sell for huge $$$ and all erc20 erc 721 can be deployed on our own chain. Also, PoA is highly secure and uses less energy. In this method we will have our own validator and our own nodes.\n\nThe idea of reaching out to the community is the root of this intuitive project. Aiming to make a difference by creating a blockchain that could give every developer's a platform where they can learn blockchain within a lesser gas fee ecosystem. Ring Cahin is an Ethereum based blockchain, permissionless and having an Ring Chain IBFT consensus algorithm with on-chain governance and Proof of Authority (POA) is advanced Proof of Stake (POS) with a Bonsai Tries data storage structure that will speed up the transaction and saves more data in the chain. This means that the user within the community has more access to all features and can have its validator giving access to vote and propose ideas that could enhance the system as well as earn a reward in different staking programs.\n\nRing Chain's Goal is to,\n\nMake blockchain accessible to everyone.\nPromote safety and transparency.\nEliminate the expense and complexity.",

    "overview": "The high demand for cryptocurrency and blockchain solutions is increasing the need for mining systems in the world. This is also driving up the demand for energy and a lot of waste heat is being driven. In a world where heating costs are rising every year, the need for green heating solutions is greater than ever. By combining these two problems, we can make our buildings and systems more efficient and sustainable, and thus even benefit from them. Our idea is to make use of wasted heat energy. To make this a reality, we have developed an electric heater that generates profits by mining cryptocurrencies (e.g. Bitcoin) while heating the user's environment. With other words, our smart devices heat the room or hot water because they consume energy when generating cryptocurrencies. On paper, this would be 100% heating efficiency. Thus, data centers, computers, and crypto miners could be used to provide heating and hot water to millions of households. The profits that can be made from this are usually higher than the costs incurred from electricity consumption. So not only is heating free of charge, but money is made in the process. All that is needed is a power supply and an Internet connection. ",

    "overview": "What Is Cryptocurrency Mining?\n\nCryptocurrency mining is the process in which transactions between users are verified and added to the blockchain public ledger. The process of mining is also responsible for introducing new coins into the existing circulating supply and is one of the key elements that allow cryptocurrencies to work as a peer-to-peer decentralized network, without the need for a third party central authority. \n\nBitcoin is the most popular and well-established example of a mineable cryptocurrency, but it is worth noting that not all cryptocurrencies are mineable. Bitcoin mining is based on a consensus algorithm called Proof of Work.\n\n \n\nHow does it work?\nA miner is a node in the network that collects transactions and organizes them into blocks. Whenever transactions are made, all network nodes receive them and verify their validity. Then, miner nodes gather these transactions from the memory pool and begin assembling them into a block (candidate block). \n\nThe first step of mining a block is to individually hash each transaction taken from the memory pool, but before starting the process, the miner node adds a transaction where they send themselves the mining reward (block reward). This transaction is referred to as the coinbase transaction, which is a transaction where coins get created \u2018out of thin air\u2019 and, in most cases, is the first transaction to be recorded in a new block.\n\nAfter every transaction is hashed, the hashes are then organized into something called a Merkle Tree (or a hash tree) - which is formed by organizing the various transaction hashes into pairs and then hashing them. The outputs are then organized into pairs and hashed once again, and the process is repeated until \u201cthe top of the tree\u201d is reached. The top of the tree is also called a root hash (or Merkle root) and is basically a single hash that represents all the previous hashes that were used to generate it.\n\nThe root hash - along with the hash of the previous block.",

And yet, the people benefitting from crypto are overwhelming those who are already doing pretty well for themselves. What\u2019s more: the most recognizable cryptocurrency is consuming massive amounts of energy at a time when we\u2019re in the grips of a climate crisis. \n\nBut we say, enough is enough. It\u2019s time to bring crypto and DeFi to the masses\u2014without damaging the environment. \n\nAt Spacemesh, our mission is to build a layer-one crypto protocol with a resource that many ordinary people already have: unused computer storage space. Our protocol is also race-free, meaning that everybody gets their fair share of mining rewards. Low barrier to entry and proportional rewards means that nobody will ever be priced out, keeping coin distribution fair and ensuring decentralization. \n\n This way, we\u2019ll bring crypto to the masses.",

E2E is on a larger scale that has never been seen in terms of megawatts (MW). EGRRS will output a profitable future for the economy, not only in Alberta but Canada.\n\nE2E Energy Solutions plans to develop power plants on nonproducing oil and gas sites with strong geothermal dynamics using its patent pending EGRRS process. All generated electricity will be used to power several high value revenue streams, including:\n\n- Green hydrogen via electrolysis\n- Blue hydrogen via SMR and carbon capture\n- Lithium from reservoir brines \n- AI and Crypto currency mining\n- Sustainable green house\n- Clean Water\n\n\"Aside from being essentially unlimited like many other renewables, geothermal energy is always available. It is not impacted upon by whether it is day or night like solar energy, and does not depend on season, climate or weather conditions like wind and solar power. On average, a geothermal power plant will produce energy for around 8,600 hours a year, while in solar plants the average is around 2,000 hours per year. We can therefore describe the rate of geothermal energy production as constant, at least in the short or medium term.

    "overview": "New York Coin (NYC) is a peer-to-peer cryptocurrency and open-source software project released under the MIT/X11 license. Creation and transfer of coins is based on an open source cryptographic protocol and is not managed by any central authority. New York Coin was an early Litecoin spin-off or altcoin, starting in March 2014. In technical details, New York Coin is nearly identical to Litecoin with 5 times faster confirmations, no fees to send or receive and low difficulty, energy-efficient mining built into the code. \n\nThe New York Coin Center was founded by Charlie Kartchner in 2018 in the SoHo district of New York City. NYC Coin supporters worldwide raised funds for a 6 month 'pop-up lease' of a retail storefront located at 167 Mott Street, New York, NY 10013. The New York Coin Center was a Cryptocurrency Information Center highlighting the benefits of New York Coin (NYC) over Bitcoin and Litecoin. Established to further retail-level adoption of NewYorkCoin and to promote education on cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology. It displayed Keith Haring motif and raised awareness about the open-source specs of New York Coin cryptocurrency and its retail-level usability benefits over other major cryptocurrencies.",

Our vision is to offer our clients a reliable, secure and fast data center of applications they choose to run on our data center. We also build and operate crypto mining farms to provide hosting services of mining machines including Bitcoin, Ethereum and other crypto currencies from our clients globally. In order to build data centers and crypto mining farms, we work with electricity cooperatives and energy companies all over the United States of America to find and secure the adequate and sustainable power resource. After the construction is done, operation is performed through SpiderMining team and other third-party operating teams.  \n\nSecondly, SpiderMining also focuses on the ecological construction of blockchain nodes, providing professional mining pool services through our parent company SpiderPool, as well as all-round  services such as related mining machine transactions and mining software system development, and mining machine trading.\n\nOur intention is to ensure that we make profits as is legally permissible by the laws of the state where we are operating data centers and crypto mining farms as well as all over the United States of America.

    "overview": "Zypdo proposes a Web 3.0 ready, distributed streaming network, leveraging best of breed, peer-2-peer technology, based on blockchain architecture, in the form of a Distributed Autonomous Organisation (DAO), powered by multiple-thousands of distributed nodes.\n\nContent creators, up-mining streamers, viewers, DAO governors, administrators and network managers will all be incentivized to participate in running and optimizing the network.\n\nZypdo aims to turn the advertising paradigm on its head. Instead of impatiently waiting for adverts to end, viewers can choose to watch them in their own time, before, during, after a stream or never. Most CDNs offer an optional ad-free experience for a monthly fee. With Zypdo, ad-free is the default.\n\nBut Zypdo\u2019s truly radical differentiator is to transform the \u2018ad-break\u2019 into a positive and lucrative experience. Zypdo will reward the viewer with a generous share of the advertiser\u2019s click charge for every advert viewed in its entirety and confirmed by an active response at the end. And not just the viewers, since one hundred percent of all advertising revenue will be shared with all the members of the DAO.\n\nAdvertisers will benefit from greater engagement, since their messages are viewed from start to finish and the viewer must interact with the content by answering a question, downloading a voucher or clicking through to the advertiser\u2019s site at the end to confirm that engagement.\n\nIn keeping with the democratic principles of the blockchain and it\u2019s DAO structure, any interested party can stake for a seat on the Governing Council, submit suggestions, vote on policy decisions and help guide the future of the network.\n\nIn short, Zypdo envisages a truly democratic, community-run streaming experience where every participant receives a share.",

    "overview": "It's a new world whether we like it or not. Whatever worked 100% before we got hit by this pandemic, will not be half as efficient as it used to. Every company, business, individual, or organization that wants to sustain projected growth must have its top minds meet & greet in a series of brainstorming meetings to analyze what their POST PANDEMIC STRATEGY will be. Even though the pandemic is not over yet, we are starting to see the effects of thousands of companies without a post-pandemic strategy.\n\nWhere do we see this? Simple, 9 out of 10 companies we know and buy from regularly have INCREASED THEIR PRICES as a first measure or post-pandemic effect. This tells us they were and are not prepared for what's coming as sudden price increases regularly compensate for a badly planned or onion existent well structured business strategy. It's a risky move excused by the fact everyone is doing it but in the end, for some, it will be the last nail on their coffin.\n\nThe major points to be revised and restructured, (besides some other important financial and operations areas) are the following:\n\n1. Operational optimization and streaming (incorporate new updated methods)\n\n2. GTM (Go To Market) Strategy (adapt to new market and demand conditions)\n\n3. Data Mining and Management (rethink your datacenter and cloud strategies)\n\n4. Online presence (revise and update SEO, design, Digital transformation & Google)\n\n5. Target Market (the economy has a way of upsetting markets, revise or retarget)\n\n6. Sales & Marketing Strategy (incorporate new trends and opportunities)\n\n7. Location & Infrastructure (rethink On-site vs Remote, advantages & disadvantages)\n\n8. Cryptocurrency & NFT (need to be incorporated into the annual business plan)\n\n9. Multiplication & Expansion strategy (time to look for new emerging markets)\n\n10. Logistics & Supply Chain strategy (time to entirely rethink and reshape)\n\nIf you or your company need help to organize your NEW BUSINESS POST-PANDEMIC STRATEGY, let us help.",

The miners are the individuals committing resources to acquiring and scaling the processing power that allows for transaction verification and scaling the tools involved in mining.\n\nMuch like VISA and AMEX have done previously on their own, in building out massive data centers to improve the speed of transactions and manage the accounts tied to each users cards, crypto miners are leveraging the newest technology that allows for these types of transactions to be managed, verified and monitored using Blockchain technology.\n \nIn mining there are a variety of disciplines required to design, build and manage these facilities.  All of these create a layered tapestry by which there is a talent deficit. \n \nOne of the main goals of The MINING MAGAZINE is to attract new talent into the industry by providing education and inspiration to anyone who has been curious about how it all works.

Because of its low cost structure, BitRiver can remain profitable even if the price of Bitcoin were to fall 85% over two years. Having the lowest cost structure will allow BitRiver to survive as the blockchain security data center industry matures and turns into a new utility. We will establish the first mining facility located in Siberia with a total capacity of up to 100MW of power. Our investors are some of the most sophisticated and reputable investors in the world.",

Now, every connection is moving to Facebook, Google Plus, Twitter, Linkedin, vk etc. So, if you haven't got  face  you aren't part of new-generation social life. facebit.network was born at this point. Now, you can easily support your ideas, dreams or groups on Facebook or Linkedin with your social network connections and Facebit Coin. All you need for using our system is a Facebook, Twitter, Linkedin or Google Plus account. Simply log in and start a new social or business project, then fund it with your social connections! All funds keep in our escrow system, if you cancel your project all funds will be returned to funders. That's easy and safe.\n\nAbout facebit coin;\n\nFacebit Coin (FBN) developed based on Bitcoin. But, Facebit's algorithm is SCRIPT as a proof-of-work like Litecoin. So, everybody can mine Facebit easily on their stuff like mobile phones or tablets etc. Total Facebit Coin (FBN) supply is 10 Billions coins (Bitcoin's total supply is 21.000.000 coins) and everyone can create smart-contract on Facebit.Network (also, every facebit based budget project is kind of smart contract).\n\n Our mission: Creating most profitable coin! \nFacebit has a dream about all poor people: Facebit Coin will be kind of solution for people who lives in countries where it is difficult to find job and / or reach the money. That's why we developed Facebit Coin for mobile platforms (cell phones and tablets). Also people can use Android netbooks for mining, too.\n\n Our vission: Developing real money via crypto-currency! \nWe inspired by Bitcoin. But Bitcoin could not be real money in economy. Now, Bitcoin is one of investment instruments in market, like other alt-coins. Our opinion, Bitcoin is the previous step in the evolution of money. And we are presenting to you last step of money evolution: Facebit Coin.\n",

Cobidex is a one-of-a-kind proposition that is here to disrupt the crypto exchange landscape and reshape the very future of crypto.\n\nCobidex Features:\n\nTrade Mining \nCobi tokens come into circulation through \u201ctrade mining.\u201d The trade mining incentive rewards traders for simply using the Cobidex platform to trade. Cobi tokens will be rewarded to traders 100% in line with the trading fee paid. Traders will receive their Cobi tokens every 24 hours based on the trading activity generated on the exchange that day. Users can stake the tokens received from trade mining to earn a daily yield from the entirety of Cobidex\u2019s daily revenue.\n\nReferral Mining\nAs a pure community-owned exchange, participating on Cobidex is invite-only. Each Cobidex user receives five invites to bring like-minded traders to Cobidex. Once invitees register their account and begin trading on Cobidex, the Referral Mining bonus will reward users with 20% of their invitees\u2019 trading fees in perpetuity.\n\nCommunity Market Making\nAll Cobi holders benefit from a monthly share of the exchange\u2019s total market-making activity. This reward, known as the CMM (Community Market Making), is a unique feature to Cobidex that rewards all traders for the essential part they play in the exchange\u2019s success. The idea behind CMM is to implement a new kind of fairer and transparent market making that gives some degree of protection to retail traders.\n\nLiquidity Mining\nCobidex users can earn a passive income by staking their existing tokens. Liquidity mining can be done with BTC, USDT, ETH, and other alt-tokens, with APY paid out in the deposited token. On top of the APY paid out on the deposited token, an additional payout is made in Cobi.\n",

This feature is excellent because the network\u2019s liquidity will be fair to all participants; no whale will be able to manipulate the price of DYP to their advantage.",

    "overview": "The dramatic growth of the cryptocurrency market represents a rare wealth-building opportunity for accredited investors. In the estimation of many experts, cryptocurrencies may be the only new asset classes created in decades. This watershed event has the potential to be a wealth-generation phenomenon analogous to the American railroad boom of the mid-nineteenth century or the internet boom of the late 1990s. Yet, unlike the 1990s dotcom bubble, for example, salient financial principles underscore the expected staying-power of these new currencies. In particular, cryptocurrency both represents a new asset class and embodies many of the same features of fiat currencies while simultaneously being more secure. \n Like many growing markets, cryptocurrency constitutes a type of land grab, with investors jockeying for market share. Some investors may very likely garner substantial wealth, and, coincidentally, experience extreme volatility. The beneficiaries of this market will massively outperform those who are underexposed to this asset class.\n\nTo this end, and endeavoring to capitalized on this opportunity, Opulen Technologies is generalized mining company in the blockchain ecosphere. Opulen Technologies examine cryptocurrency networks and evaluates the strength of networks based on their development activity, robustness of the code base, and a myriad of the other factors that, in the end, like an Aswath Damodaran class, may more closely cohere to a type of valuation framework for Open Source Projects. Informed by Benjamin Mako Hill's notion that the mean contributor to an Open Source Project is one, the Opulen Research Team closely evaluates the knowledge and network claims made by cryptocurrency teams and interrogate whether said coins, in fact, have any traction, or substance behind their marketcap. By combining a close code review, the knowledge of a team, and the nature of the cryptocurrency code, Opulen endeavors to accurately evaluate current crypto projects. ",

The result is an application that trades on your behalf which is incredibly simple to use and offers unmatched results.\n\nWe are working hard everyday to add more exchanges on to the platforms and currently offer both cryptocurrency trading and leverage trading options using our systems (binance and bitmex).

Block Rewards have 7 eras of reduction, including a dev reward enabled after block 5000. Developers and Community Managers are bound by a continuity agreement to maintain the network, community, and coin. There is no cap to EGEM at the moment. \nA monetary cap will be put in place when the community determines that the logical progression would be to cap the coin.\n\nAn \"applied technologies peernet\"\u200b is where the EtherGem blockchain grows on a mineable sidechain. The EGEM sidechain is designed to be very much an integral part of ongoing mainchain development, where peers can implement new technology while continuing to rely on a solid foundation. \n\nDiscord: https://discordapp.com/invite/zav3EkW\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/ethergemcoin\nCMC: https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/ethergem/",

The team shares a common interest in Blockchain Technology & Digital Assets.\n\nBlock Asset Management bring to market a holistic approach to the world\u2019s newest and fastest growing asset class. After a year of global market research we realised that interest in the Crypto space was extremely high however understanding of the sector was limited. Institutional investors are reluctant to invest in a single manager or strategy. It was this feedback that confirmed to Block Asset Management that a more diverse investment opportunity was required and the idea of the world\u2019s first Blockchain/Cryptocurrency FOF was created. \n\nMany funds exist in the crypto space, but most do not pass any meaningful FIAT/mature market due diligence. Using the team's experience we were able to carry out months of extensive due diligence on dozens of funds and eventually approved a select number funds to create the Blockchain Strategies Fund, a Luxembourg Fund of Funds complete with an independent third-party custodian, administrator & auditor.\n\nWe are in the early adoption stages of Cryptocurrency/Blockchain Technology and investor demand will increase dramatically.
